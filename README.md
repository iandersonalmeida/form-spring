# Springboot Form
This project covers MVC architecture, using the Spring Boot framework
to build a simple runtime data capture and storage form.

## Description
The MVC architecture is a software architecture pattern that separates an application in the development process into three components: Model, View and Controller. The model refers to the related data logic; the view corresponds to the application's UI; and the controller acts as an interface between the model and the view. With Spring Boot, being an extension of Spring, it makes it easier to create applications within a ready-made environment. The form developed addresses Spring MVC, where view requests are managed by a controller and updated by the model.
